    "description": "Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made by boiling dried kelp (seaweed) and dried bonito (fish). Instant dashi granules are sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets and vary in strength. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white or red miso paste for this soup. Yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.",

Typically, it is made with canned tuna, eggs, finely diced vegetables, a bit of flour, fine sea salt and black pepper. But in today’s recipe, I added a dollop of mayonnaise to moisten the tuna. If you are not fond of mayonnaise you can certainly skip it but it does add value. ",
